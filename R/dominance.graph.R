#' @title Partial ranking as directed graph
#' @description Turns a partial ranking into a directed graph. An edge (u,v) is 
#' present if `P[u,v]=1`, meaning that u is dominated by v.
#'
#' @param P A partial ranking as matrix object calculated with [neighborhood_inclusion]
#'    or [positional_dominance].
#' @return Directed graph as an igraph object.
